### About me

Senior iOS Software Engineer with 6 years of experience, including 2 years as Mobile Team-lead at VK. My experience as Software Engineer included: creating an architecture of the app from zero to production, creating a design system, and supporting a development environment (CI/CD, scripts, etc.). I am capable of writing and supporting any complex system (within reason).
I like to invest time in open-source projects, creating tools and apps for developers.
The most loved libraries I've created are:

  * SwiftDI¬†- I have created a library to understand how DI works inside. In SwiftDI I've used the DSL paradigm and a new property wrapper feature of Swift. The best feature I've created is parsing Swift AST to highlight unused dependencies.
  * LiteRoute¬†- This is the first library I've created. The main goal is to give developers the best tool to routing between VIPER modules.
  * AdaEngine¬†- I try to learn 3D rendering and create a flexible game engine for Apple Platforms.

Also, I contributed to¬†Godot Engine¬†and other little libraries.


### PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
  * iOS Development: Swift, Objective-C, C++, CoreData, Firebase, Combine, SwiftUI, JavaScriptCore, CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager (SPM), SQLite, Core Graphics, Metal, Apple Push Notifications.
