Vladislav Prusakov
iOS Senior Software Engineer

Moscow
+7 (995) 501-41-69

Senior iOS Software Engineer with 6 years of experience, including 2 years as Mobile Team-lead at VK. My experience as Software Engineer included: creating an architecture of the app from zero to production, creating a design system, and supporting a development environment (CI/CD, scripts, etc.). I am capable of writing and supporting any complex system (within reason).
I like to invest my time in my open-source projects, creating tools and apps for developers.
The most loved libraries I've created are:

  SwiftDI¬†- I have created a library to understand how DI works inside. In SwiftDI I've used the DSL paradigm and a new property wrapper feature of Swift. The best feature I've created is parsing Swift AST to highlight not used dependencies.
  LiteRoute¬†- This is the first library I've created. The main goal is to give developers the best tool to routing between VIPER modules.
  AdaEngine¬†- I try to learn 3D rendering and create a flexible game engine for Apple Platforms.

Also, I contributed to¬†Godot Engine¬†and other little libraries.

I believe that this step can grow my teammates as skilled engineers.
